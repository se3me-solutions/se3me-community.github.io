# Se3Me Community - Website 💻

## Hello world 🌍

This is our Se3Me Community's website.

## What the heck is "*Se3Me Community*" ❓

*Se3Me Community* is a project to connect programmers from all over the world who like our startup and, at the same time, programmers who want to learn more and more.

"I really enjoy learning. To me I find it as essencial as eating - either you die or your pretty miserable without it." - Santiago Gonzales.

## How can I contribute ❓

* Correct simple grammar mistakes (we are humans and sometimes we do make mistakes);
* Give ideas (we'all love new amazing ideas);
* Share it with your friends (they might like us :D);

**And smile, _'cause it's good to be different_** 🤓
